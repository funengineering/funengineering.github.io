# RPi-based temperature and humidity logger for Shelly HT (Part 6: Using Node-RED to store temperature and humidity values in InfluxDB)

Now the Shelly H&T sensors transmit their data to the MQTT broker running on your Raspberry Pi. You will now create a "flow" in Node-RED that takes this data and passes it on to InfluxDB, where it is stored. With InfluxDB, it is also possible to visualize the data, but that's not the topic of this part of the tutorial. The goal of this part is only to feed the collected into InfluxDB for permanent storage.


## Preparations

### Web interface of Node-RED

Navigate to the web interface of Node-RED running on your RPi. In my case, I enter the address `192.168.178.28:1880` in a browser of a computer running in the same local network. `192.168.178.28` is the IP address of my RPi and `1880` is the port where it provides the web interface of Node-RED. If you have followed the tutorial, the port number should also be 1880 in your case. However, the IP address of your RPi depends on your particular local network and might be different. If you are unsure about the IP address of your RPi, review [part 1 of this tutorial](/2025/02/18/01-RPi-based_temperature_and_humidity_logger_for_Shelly_HT.html), particularly the section "Network settings".

When your browser shows the web interface of Node-RED, you should see an empty flow at the center of the window.

### Installation of the InfluxDB Node-RED package

By default, Node-RED does not have nodes to access InfluxDB. The first step is thus to add them by installing the InfluxDB Node-RED package.

To do so, click on the hamburger menu icon (the three horizontal bars right of the deploy button) and select "Manage palette". The palette settings appear. Switch to the "Installation" tab at the top. In the "search modules" field, enter "node-red-contrib-influxdb". There should be only a few hits for this search. For the one that is called exactly "node-red-contrib-influxdb", click on the install button.

A message will appear, allowing you to review the documentation of the module. Once you've done that, confirm the installation by clicking the "install" button. Some moving bars indicate the installation process. Then, you will receive a notification that new nodes were added to the palette. Close the settings.

Back in the main view of Node-RED, scroll down in the palette on the left. At the bottom, in the "Storage" section, you should see three nodes called "influxdb in", "influxdb out" and "influxdb out".

## Creating a flow for one sensor

### Node for fetching the temperature data from the MQTT broker

First, you need a node that receives data every time the sensor publishes a new set of values. In the palette, scroll down to the "Network" section and drag an "mqtt in" node into your blank flow. Double-click on the mqtt node in your flow to open its properties.

<img src="/docs/assets/img/ht_logger/Screenshot%202025-04-21%20214322.png" alt="Default properties of the mqtt node" width="600"/>

As no server is defined so far, click on the plus sign on the "Server" line to add the details of the MQTT server to use. The properties view opens.

In the "Name" field, you can freely choose a server name. In my case, I used "Mosquitto on 192.168.178.28". You may want to name it similarly.

In the "Server" field, enter the IP address of your RPi. In my case, it is 192.168.178.28. The predefined port number 1883 is fine, leave it as it is. You can also leave the check mark for "Connect automatically". The TLS option can remain unchecked as we are not using any encryption for the data transfer from the MQTT broker to Node-RED.

All other options can remain at their default values (Protocol: MQTT V3.1.1, Client-ID: empty, Keep-Alive: 60, Session: clean session checked).

<img src="/docs/assets/img/ht_logger/Screenshot%202025-04-21%20215458.png" alt="Server settings: connection tab" width="600"/>

Switch to the Security tab. Enter the user name and password you defined for Mosquitto in [part 2](/2025/02/18/02-RPi-based_temperature_and_humidity_logger_for_Shelly_HT.html) of this tutorial (section "Mosquitto configuration).

<img src="/docs/assets/img/ht_logger/Screenshot%202025-04-21%20215514.png" alt="Server settings: security tab" width="600"/>

In the "Messages" tab, there is no need to change the default settings. Click the "Add" button at the top right to activate the server settings.

<img src="/docs/assets/img/ht_logger/Screenshot%202025-04-21%20215946.png" alt="Server settings: messages tab" width="600"/>

This will take you back to the properties of the mqtt node. Now, the "Server" field shows the server name you entered before.

For "Action", leave the default "Subscribe to single topic". In the "Topic" field, repeat what you entered as "MQTT prefix"  during the sensor configuration (part 5 of this tutorial, section "Adjusting the sensorâ€™s settings"). In the same field, just behind of what you just entered, add "/status/temperature:0" (no spaces). In my case, the "Topic" field contains "shellies/altbau/eg/ht8554/status/temperature:0".

Leave QoS (quality of service) at the default value of 2.

Change "Output" to "a parsed JSON object".

Finally, choose a meaningful name for the node. In my case, it is named "Temp_EG", referring to the fact that it provides the temperature value ("Temp") of the sensor on the ground floor ("EG").

Click on "Done" to activate the settings. This will take you back to the flow.

## Save the flow

[Save the flow and store it somewhere outside of your RPi.]


## What's next?

Now that you have a growing collection of temperature and humidity data, you might want to visualize it nicely. Take a look at the next step of the tutorial to see how this is done.
