# RPi-based temperature and humidity logger for Shelly HT (Part 6: Using Node-RED to store temperature and humidity values in InfluxDB)

Now the Shelly H&T sensors transmit their data to the MQTT broker running on your Raspberry Pi. You will now create a "flow" in Node-RED that takes this data and passes it on to InfluxDB, where it is stored. With InfluxDB, it is also possible to visualize the data, but that's not the topic of this part of the tutorial. The goal of this part is only to feed the collected into InfluxDB for permanent storage.

## What's next?

Now that you have a growing collection of temperature and humidity data, you might want to visualize it nicely. Take a look at the next step of the tutorial to see how this is done.
