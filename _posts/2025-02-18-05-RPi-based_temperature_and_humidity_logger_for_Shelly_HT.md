# RPi-based temperature and humidity logger for Shelly HT (Part 5: Configuration of the Shelly devices)

The Shelly H&T sensors will transmit their measured temperature and humidity data to your RPi. To make this work, you have to provide them with information about the target and the transmission channel. This part of the tutorial explains how to adjust the sensors' settings accordingly.


## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you are using a [Shelly H&T](https://www.shelly.com/de/products/shelly-h-t-gen3-matte-white) Wi-Fi temperature and humidity sensor. I'm not affiliated in any way with the producer of these devices. However, I'm using them myself because they're not limited to proprietary protocols and because they also work if one does not want to feed all data into the supplier's cloud. Additionally, they work for many months on normal batteries, they display the data on their integrated e-paper display, and I like their design.

If you have a different sensor, you might also be able to use it. If it provides its data using MQTT, you just have to figure out (by yourself) the correct settings. If it uses a different protocol, you might still be able to access the data with Node-RED, but this will require additional changes (most likely in Node-RED) that will not be addressed in this tutorial.
